# Expo CLI Build Error: Third-Party Library Incompatibility

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Expo CLI with third-party libraries. The problem arises from a mismatch between the library's requirements and Expo's managed workflow, resulting in cryptic error messages during the build process.  The provided solution showcases how to identify and resolve this conflict.

## Bug Description

When attempting to build an Expo app using a library that doesn't fully support Expo's managed workflow (or has incorrect configuration), the build process fails. The error messages are usually not very informative, leading to debugging challenges.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the third-party library's documentation for Expo compatibility.  This might involve using a specific Expo-compatible version, configuring the library correctly within your Expo project, or even exploring alternative libraries.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Attempt to run `expo start`.
4. Observe the build error.  Then try applying the solution in `bugSolution.js`.
