The solution depends on the specific library causing the issue.  Generally, strategies involve:

1. **Checking Library Compatibility:** Consult the third-party library's documentation to see if it's officially supported by Expo.  Look for any Expo-specific instructions or examples.
2. **Using Expo-Compatible Version:**  Ensure you're using a version of the library known to work with Expo. Check the library's release notes or repository for compatibility information.
3. **Correct Configuration:** Double-check that you've followed all the necessary configuration steps for the library within your Expo project (often involving linking, installation, and proper import/usage).
4. **Exploring Alternatives:** If the library proves problematic or unsupported, consider finding an alternative library with better Expo compatibility. 

Example (Illustrative): Let's say the problematic library is `react-native-unofficial-library`.  The solution might involve finding a similar library that is Expo compatible, or carefully examining its documentation for instructions on using it in Expo.
